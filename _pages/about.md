*People think that mathematics is complicated. Mathematics is the simple bit, it‚Äôs the stuff we CAN understand. It‚Äôs cats that are complicated.*
John Conway

As a data scientist, economist, and programmer, the defining factor in my academic and professional career is the study of networks and complex systems.

I received my undergraduate degree in Economics from University College London (UCL); I worked for the UK government and have research experience at the World Bank and the Fields Institute in Toronto. Currently, I am developing a Knowledge Graph for state-of-the-art NLP models.

I am now delving deeper into the theoretical underpinnings and computational paradigms that make network and graph theory so powerful. My research areas are:

- understanding human-made, artificial systems using concepts and tools from information science, computer science, and the natural sciences
- applying quantum algorithms on graph problems
- developing socio-economic Agent-Based Models
- exploring the concept of diffusion in networks, with a particular interest in cultural evolution

I'm always looking to meet interesting people that share my passion for networks, complexity and computation. Don't hesitate to reach out!

During the day, I work as a Data Scientist at [YUKKA Lab](https://www.yukkalab.com/), developing a Knowledge Graph, modelling the international business and economic ecosystem, for our NLP models. Our KG has been scaled to over 2.5m entities and over 7m relations. Our Knowledge Graph is used for Named-Entity Linking, Named-Entity Recognition and is enriched by a Relation Extraction model.

I also have a soft spot for edible insects and novel food trends. Started my own mealworm farm and wrote about it for my bachelor's thesis.

I am also still serving in the Swiss Army, as Grenadier - Breacher (Swiss Army Special Forces).

Otherwise, you might find me at a crossfit box or weightlifting gym, learning chinese or collecting pin's.
