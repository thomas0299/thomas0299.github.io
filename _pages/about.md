*People think that mathematics is complicated. Mathematics is the simple bit, it‚Äôs the stuff we CAN understand. It‚Äôs cats that are complicated.*
John Conway

As a network scientist, economist, and programmer, the defining factor in my academic and professional career is the study of complex systems.

I received my undergraduate degree in Economics from University College London (UCL); I worked for the UK government and have research experience at the World Bank and the Fields Institute in Toronto. I also helped develop a Knowledge Graph for NLP models at YUKKA Lab, a Berlin based start-up.

I am now delving deeper into the theoretical underpinnings and computational paradigms that make network and graph theory so powerful. I have started my PhD in Advanced Computing at Tsinghua University. There, I am under the supervision of Prof. Carlo V. Cannistraci at the Center for Complex Network Intelligence Center (CCNI) at the Tsinghua Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence  (THIB). My research will focus on novel network algorithms, analysing socio-economic networks and understanding the complexity of the world around us through the power of computation. I am also an Affiliate Researcher at the Wolfram Institute, where I write about Graphs, Ruliology and the Mathematica Language.

I've played sports all my life: football, tennis, running. At university I fell in love with Olympic Weightlifting. I became President of our Barbell club, medalled at the National University championships, and got my coaching (BWL Lv2) and refereeing licences.

I then turned to the dark side, and now intensely train Crossfit, a beautiful methodology that claims to be the ultimate test of fitness (I agree ;) ).

I was also serving in the Swiss Army, as Grenadier - Breacher (Swiss Army Special Forces).

Finally, I have a soft spot for edible insects and novel food trends. I believe they are one of the solutions to solve some of our environmental challenges. Started my own mealworm farm and wrote about it for my Bachelor thesis.

I'm always looking to meet interesting people that share my passion for networks, complexity and computation. But also weightlifting, crossfit, learning chinese, and collecting pins. Don't hesitate to reach out!

I always was some kind of a mathematical genius, even though it was not always fully recognised by all.
