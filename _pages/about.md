*People think that mathematics is complicated. Mathematics is the simple bit, it‚Äôs the stuff we CAN understand. It‚Äôs cats that are complicated.*
John Conway

As a network scientist, economist, and programmer, the defining factor in my academic and professional career is the study of complex systems.

I received my undergraduate degree in Economics from University College London (UCL); I worked for the UK government and have research experience at the World Bank and the Fields Institute in Toronto. I also helped develop a Knowledge Graph for NLP models in a Berlin start-up.

I am now delving deeper into the theoretical underpinnings and computational paradigms that make network and graph theory so powerful. I have started my PhD in Advanced Computing at Tsinghua University. I am under the supervision of Prof. Carlo V. Cannistraci at the Center for Complex Network Intelligence Center (CCNI) at the Tsinghua Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence  (THIB). I will be working on novel network algorithms, analysing socio-economic networks and understand the complexity of the world around us through the power of computation.

I'm always looking to meet interesting people that share my passion for networks, complexity and computation. Don't hesitate to reach out!

I also have a soft spot for edible insects and novel food trends. Started my own mealworm farm and wrote about it for my bachelor's thesis.

I am also still serving in the Swiss Army, as Grenadier - Breacher (Swiss Army Special Forces).

Otherwise, you might find me at a crossfit box or weightlifting gym, learning chinese or collecting pin's.
