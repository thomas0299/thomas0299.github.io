During the day, I work as a Data Scientist at [YUKKA Lab](https://www.yukkalab.com/), developing a knowledge graph for our NLP models. Our mission is to make news measurable and quantifiable.

Previously studied and worked as an economist in the public sector, I am still very interested in econometrics and causal inference techniques.

I also have a soft spot for edible insects and novel food trends. Started my own mealworm farm and wrote about it for my bachelor's thesis.

Otherwise, you might find me at a crossfit box or weightlifting gym, learning chinese or collecting pin's and panini football cards.
