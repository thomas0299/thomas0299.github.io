Public speaking scared me, a lot. I decided to change that in 2022, by joining Toastmasters (TM). This is an attempt to keep myself accountable and pursue this journey.

*"Toastmasters International is a nonprofit educational organization that teaches public speaking and leadership skills through a worldwide network of clubs."*

I can't recommend enough for people to give TM a try. Folks are welcoming, funny and driven. Special mention to [Center Berlin Toastmasters](https://centerberlin-toastmasters.de/), much love!

# Engaging Humor Pathway
As a member, you choose a pathway: Toastmaster's flagship education experience. You regularly deliver speeches at your local club to work on various communication skills. The goal is to complete all 'assignments' (~15) to complete a whole pathway. I chose the **Engaging Humor**:


*"This path is designed to help you build your skills as a humorous and engaging public speaker. The projects on this path focus on understanding your sense of humor and how that sense of humor translates to engaging audience members. The projects contribute to developing an understanding of how to effectively use humor in a speech, including challenging situations and impromptu speeches. This path culminates in an extended humorous speech that will allow you to apply what you learned."*

Enjoy my speeches :)

Below is when I finished my whole pathway, something I am incredibly proud of!
