Our team focused on Gender Equality, as we were a few days ahead of International Women’s Day. The idea was to come up with a “Gender Equality” index. First, the team qualitatively assessed relevant metrics that could be included in the index. Then, participants checked the availability of data for a sufficient number of companies. Finally, the index was calculated through the Wikirate platform.
