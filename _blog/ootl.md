I was invited by the Out of the Lab podcast, which tackles the tough questions in science and academia!

Out of the Lab was created by none other than Lou Kohler-Voinov, a friend with whom I've co-founded the Swiss Students in China Association (SSCA), 

We discuss the international student experience and the founding of our association. A must-listen for anyone interested in student life in China!
