# Script

Mother in law...How does THAT make you feel?  And if I told you I moved to Berlin to come and live with my mother-in-law, just the two of us?  First, though, I must admit she isn‚Äôt actually my mother-in-law, I‚Äôm a bit young for that. She‚Äôs just my girlfriend‚Äôs mother. Or should I say my ex-girlfriend‚Äôs mother. Getting weird right? Let me explain.

So I moved to Berlin not because I desperately wanted to live with and spend Christmas with my incredible mother-in-law, but because I found a really interesting job here. And my girlfriend was German, so I felt like it was a perfect opportunity to combine both work and hobby.

When I first gave this speech, I was still with my ex, she was living in Leipzig and me with her mother in Berlin, and my exact words were ‚ÄúI am confident in our future with my girlfriend, so I‚Äôm already calling her my mother-in-law‚Äù. Naive Thomas got dumped a few months later, maybe she didn‚Äôt appreciate being called a hobby, I‚Äôm not sure. Anyhow, I was devastated, not because I thought I was losing the woman of my dreams, I could get over that just fine. I was devastated because I now had to put up with her mother, who became, from one day to the next, a scary flatmate.

Now, I know what you might be thinking: Thomas, why didn‚Äôt you just move out? It‚Äôs not like she was chaining you to the bed like in 50 shades of grey. No, that‚Äôs true, and all of you have a point. BUt you need to understand, I was straight out of university: living in Berlin Mitte, with cheap rent and freshly brewed Turkish tea, I was living the jet-set life! So I decided to stick around a bit longer.

Living with her is tough. And not for the reasons you might expect. It‚Äôs not tough because she‚Äôs actually scary, or she blames me for getting dumped, (that would be weird right?) It‚Äôs tough because it requires an enormous amount of willpower to not contradict her. In the past I was courting her daughter, so I could find good reasons to be diplomatic, but now with that hobby out of the way, I‚Äôm struggling to find a reason to be. You see, my mother-in-law is German-Turkish, and she is proud, VERY proud of being Turkish. If you listened only to her, you‚Äôd think that the Ottoman Empire was still ruling the world. She is nostalgic about those times. The highest-quality furniture, the most-renowned tailors and the best carpets all come from Turkey! The Ottomans invented tea, coffee and even cheese! Cheese! She told that to a Swiss!

Last year, the first time I spent Christmas with their family, the most sensationalist claim she came up with was that Santa Claus was a Turk. Forget about St Nicholas, pagan traditions or American marketing, no: his name was Ayaz Ata, Father Frost and he was from Central Asia. He was the father of all Father Christmases! Naturally, I wasn‚Äôt convinced by this origin story, but then, I remembered the jet-set life! So I kept my mouth shut.

This illustrates very well my relationship with her, it‚Äôs like walking on eggshells. Every interaction is a fine balancing act! Can I ask her where baklava really comes from? Should I, just to be polite, ask her if her daughter is dating somebody else? What should I tell her when I come home late on Tuesday evenings? It takes overthinking to a whole new level.

But it‚Äôs definitely not all bad. She is a lovely person, with a kind heart. She‚Äôs the one who suggested I move into her spare room and helps me with my German paperwork. She has made my integration in Berlin so much smoother, despite the fact that I became single.

She did take time to warm up to me though. I was the first boyfriend her daughter brought back, so you can imagine, she didn‚Äôt really know how to act with me. The first few weeks were quite awkward. But slowly, as I ate Ottoman cheese and agreed to Turk Father Christmas, she loosened up. She used to say I‚Äôm the son she‚Äôs never had, which I was very touched by. She hasn‚Äôt said that for a while though, so maybe she‚Äôs found another son she‚Äôs never had.

One reason why I am grateful that I was living (and still am) with her is that I was able to get a glimpse of what my future might have looked like, by looking at her relationship with my father-in-law, or however you want to call him. My mother-in-law, and coincidently, her daughter, have, let‚Äôs say, dictatorial traits. A bit like a certain modern Turkish politician. As a result, the father gave up a long time ago, he let the wife run the house. He‚Äôs one of the smarter ones it seems and he must have agreed to Turk Father Christmas a long time ago. I tried to do the same, with their daughter, but, evidently, it didn‚Äôt work.

On the whole, my mother-in-law is still more Ataturk than Erdogan. And she wasn‚Äôt that far from the truth with Santa Claus, there are some origin stories that do trace him back to modern day Turkey. So he was actually even Turkish, not just Turk! It wasn‚Äôt Central Asia, and it wasn‚Äôt exactly Father Frost, she just got some of the details wrong.

In the end we do get along well. And the reason why I do try so hard to please my mother-in-law/scary flatmate is not just because of my jet-set life. It‚Äôs also maybe because I cling on to the hope of reclaiming her daughter, so, for the moment, to keep my hobby options open, I will be drinking her freshly brewed Turkish tea, eating Ottoman cheese and worshipping Turk Father Christmas.
