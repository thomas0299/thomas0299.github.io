# Script

Let‚Äôs be honest, unless you have ground-breaking news about Biden being a lizard or a lion roaming the streets of Berlin, nobody will read your blog.
 
And you just have to accept that! I started writing my blog during my last year of university. I must confess that I was lied to by Medium and those other blogging platforms. They made me think I could just earn passive income by writing average blog posts on their platform. That I wouldn‚Äôt need to find a proper job and could retire on a beach in Vanuatu before I‚Äôd even started working properly. Aaah, was I na√Øve! That didn‚Äôt happen of course, but I‚Äôm still hopeful, maybe this speech and the outreach I‚Äôm doing now will boost my numbers up.
 
Nevertheless, saying to people ‚ÄúI have a blog‚Äù makes you look really cool, and makes your email signature more potent. But seriously, I really appreciate my blog because I use it as a way to tell my own story, in my own way: I choose the narrative, the angle and how I portray myself.
 
Being able to tell my own story gives back the power of employment and income-finding into my own hands. First, I choose who I want to be, what I want to work on, what I find interesting and important. Then employers, collaborators and academics contact me because their project or opportunity suits me, and not the other way around. Instead of changing yourself to fit a job, you let the suitable opportunities find you! At least that‚Äôs what I tell myself, this hasn‚Äôt worked just yet, I am still painfully applying to jobs and universities, but I really do believe that in time this will pay off.
 
My blog has forced me to expand and make my own personal website, I was sick of paying for Medium, these rascals were taking money off me instead of growing my bank account.
I‚Äôm pretty proud of my personal website, considering I don‚Äôt have any front-end knowledge, thank you obscure stranger on GitHub providing templates!
 
I even have a small section where I post my Toastmaster speeches, scripts and videos. This enables me to share them with friends and family, not to rewatch them myself, God forbid. Although I am selective about who I send which speeches too: my parents would freak out if they saw how I talk about them in my speech, or my ex about how I talk about her mom.
 
Blogging has taught me to write and organize my ideas better, I really feel like my written communication improved. It has also had an impact on my speech writing at Toastmaster. Overall, I enjoy the fact that it‚Äôs a relatively well-curated summary of my professional and academic career. I would really encourage anybody to have their own personal blog and website, just don‚Äôt expect anybody to read it or earn any money from it! Just do it for the love of literature, art and prose!
