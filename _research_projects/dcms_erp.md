**Chief Advisersâ€™ foreword**

In February, the Prime Minister asked us to lead a review of how events with larger crowd sizes could return without social distancing, while limiting the transmission of COVID-19 as much as practical. The Prime Minister assigned us this role so that we could build an evidence base with which to get the public back into the places they have missed so much, from football grounds, to theatres, to live music venues. This report presents the findings from Phase I of the Events Research Programme (ERP) to inform how events can be reopened with reduced risk. The report does not make conclusive public health recommendations on the reopening of events at this stage.
